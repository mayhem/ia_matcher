ia_matcher
==========

Internet Archive audio track to MusicBrainz release matching tool

This tool uses ia_download.py to download data from the Internet Archive for a list of items into a local postgres db.
Then mb_matcher.py picks items from the DB, tries to match them and saves matches/errors back to the DB.

The err field in the match table of the DB stores a free form text string of what happened during the last time that
this "match" was worked on. Possible values include:

 * cannot parse ia json
 * too few tracks on this release
 * 0 tracks found in json
 * release with missing track duration
 * incomplete tracklist
 * key error in ia json
 * match below threshold
 * no toc match
 
 Knowing the error, the script can be improved to try and match more data or improve the parsing scripts to deal
 the shitty inbound data.
 
 When a match is found, the result is written to the mbid column in the match table.
